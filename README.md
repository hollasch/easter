Easter
====================================================================================================

This is a simple C++ program that I originally written up in Perl, based on a 1993-07-06 Usenet
article on the sci.math newsgroup. See the comment block in `easter.cpp` for the algorithm.

To use the program, run without arguments to see the next Easter date, or run with the year number
to see the date of Easter for that year.

Also included here is the Windows CMD script to evoke the program using Perl (`easter.cmd`), and the
raw Perl script (`easter.pl`).
